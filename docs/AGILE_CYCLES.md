# OBJECTIVE: LumaOps Adaptive Orchestration Cycles

## 1. Cycle Structure
Cycle: milestone-based loop.
Phases: Intent > Orchestrate > Execute > Retro > Compound.
Gate: 85% of the current milestone is hardened before opening a new build thread.

## 2. Intent Phase
- Define: Natural language spec from CONCEPT.md.
- Decompose: Supervisor agent breaks to tasks.
- Assign: Route to specialists (planner, executor, remediator).
- Gate: Solves pain? Flag bias.

## 3. Orchestrate Phase
- Supervisor: Delegates; shared memory via MEMORY.md.
- Tools: Interface TECHSTACK.md.
- Human-on-Loop: Escalate ambiguities.

## 4. Execute Phase
- Micro-Steps: Atomic via IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.
- Tier: Opus intent; Sonnet execute; Haiku test.
- Diagnostics: Uptime/output flags in SESSION_LOGS.md.

## 5. Retro Phase
- Review: AUDIT.md gates; churn/MRR metrics.
- Shred: Red-team failures.
- Evidence: Manifests/logs.

## 6. Compound Phase
- Log: Failures to SKILLS_COMPOUNDING.md.
- Supersede: Update PATTERNS.md if patterns recur.

## 7. Verification Gates
- Intent Alignment: Matches CONCEPT.md.
- Outcome: dashboard usefulness and connector trustworthiness cross-referenced.
- Hardening: typecheck, lint, tests, browser smoke, and hygiene pass once code exists.

Update Protocol: Supersede phases for new trends.
